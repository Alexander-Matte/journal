# Simple Journal CRUD application in PHP with MySQL and Bootstrap

I created this application to explore the fundamentals of CRUD operations, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and SOLID principles within a basic Journal application. Developed using PHP, HTML, and CSS (enhanced with Bootstrap), this project servesd as a hands-on learning experience for me as a beginner with the interest to strengthen my web development skills.

## Deployment Notes

Please note that this Journal CRUD application was not designed for deployment or external usage. It was crafted as a personal learning project to explore the fundamentals of PHP, OOP, and MySQL within a local development environment.

Deployment Limitations:

1.) Local Development Only: The application is intended for local development purposes. I utilized the built-in PHP server to serve the files locally, allowing for a straightforward and hassle-free development experience.

2.) MySQL Docker Container: The app interacts with a MySQL database, which was set up within a Docker container. The database is part of the local development environment and is not configured for external access.

3.) PHPAdmin for Database Manipulation: To facilitate database interactions, I incorporated PHPAdmin, a web-based administration tool for MySQL. This tool was used locally to create and manipulate the database.

While the application offered a rich learning experience for PHP, OOP, and MySQL, it lacks the necessary configurations and security measures for deployment in a live environment. Please use this project exclusively for educational and personal development purposes within a controlled local setup.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the features, and gain insights into web development practices. If you have any questions regarding the development process or the application itself, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
